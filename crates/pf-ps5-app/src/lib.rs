//! The PS5 client's application, portable and free of `unsafe`.
//!
//! Layered, dependencies pointing inward: `core` (domain, no I/O) ← `services` (store, discovery,
//! pinned TLS, art) ← `session` (streaming on punktfunk-core) ← `ui` (the shared console's
//! service) ← `runtime` (the menu and stream loops). `platform` holds the seams the binary fills
//! with the console's or a dev box's implementations; nothing here names either.
