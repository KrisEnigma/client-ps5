The question this answers: *the console can run Vulkan and decode HEVC, the shared crates draw the
console UI and speak the protocol — what has to be built, in which order, so that a tester with a
13.60 console and a developer without one can bring up a client that plays 4K120?*

## 0. Decisions

1. **Rust owns the application; C stays at three boundaries.** The payload SDK's startup objects
   and link stubs, RADV (Mesa's Vulkan driver, C) and PyroWave (C++) are linked in as archives.
   Nothing else is C. No SDL, no FFmpeg, no PipeWire, no bundled GL. `unsafe` lives in two
   crates — `pf-ps5-sys` (the console's C ABI) and `pf-ps5-vk` (the Vulkan plane) — and every
   other crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
2. **One Vulkan device for the process's life.** RADV from the Mesa PS5 port is linked into the
   title; the console UI (Skia's Vulkan backend), PyroWave decode, the HEVC/H.264 presentation
   shader and the stream overlays all run on that device. The swapchain is `VK_KHR_display` on
   VideoOut. There is no second graphics API in the binary and no handover between UI and stream.
3. **The console's libraries where the console has one.** VideoOut (reached through RADV's
   swapchain), AudioOut, Pad, UserService, SystemService, Sysmodule, the kernel's direct-memory
   calls and BSD sockets through libkernel, Videodec2 for H.264/HEVC. Third-party native code is
   limited to RADV (+ zlib/zstd), PyroWave (+ Granite), libc++, Skia and libopus.
4. **Two video lanes, one presenter.** PyroWave decodes on the GPU through the shared
   `pf-client-video` decoder. H.264/HEVC decode through Videodec2 into direct memory that the
   presenter imports as a Vulkan image (`VK_EXT_external_memory_host`, the same mechanism RADV's
   PS5 swapchain uses for its own buffers); a staged upload is the measured fallback. Both lanes
   end in the shared planar CSC shader. No AV1: nothing public shows Videodec2 decoding it, and
   RADV on the console is built without Vulkan Video.
5. **Output is the console's one mode.** 3840×2160, at 59.94 Hz or at 119.88 Hz when the title's
   `param.json` declares high-frame-rate output and the display takes it. A 1080p or 1440p stream
   is scaled by the presenter into that target, as every other client does with `video_fit`.
   SDR first: the Vulkan swapchain exposes `B8G8R8A8` sRGB only; HDR is §9.
6. **A title, not a payload.** The release is a folder `/data/homebrew/<TITLE_ID>/` with
   `eboot.bin`, `sce_sys/param.json` and `icon0.png`, launched from the home screen by the title
   loader the tester already runs. The client stays inside the title sandbox: identity, settings
   and logs live in `/download0` (`downloadDataSize` in `param.json`). No filesystem elevation —
   on 13.60 Videodec2 refuses to initialise once a process has left its sandbox. A bare ELF sent to
   the ELF loader on port 9021 stays the diagnostic form for runtime probes.
7. **Three implementations of every platform seam.** `ps5` (the console), `host` (a Linux or
   macOS developer box: Vulkan through the system loader, an offscreen or windowed surface,
   scripted pads, a WAV audio sink) and `fake` (tests). The seams are traits in the application
   crate; the platform crates implement them; Cargo enforces the direction. A feature is not
   "working" until a console test-run bundle (§5) says so.
8. **No new player-facing settings.** `Platform::Ps5` in `pf-console-ui` gates rows: the codec
   list includes PyroWave, window rows are off, pad glyphs on, HDR rows off until §9. Resolution
   and refresh are the existing `width`/`height`/`refresh_hz` rows with the values the console
   can scan out. Rules: `docs/settings.md` in the monorepo.
9. **Independence from the other PS5 streaming client.** ProsperoLight is read for platform
   facts — API names, struct layouts, limits, the 13.60 trap — and each fact is re-proven by a
   probe here before it is relied on. No fork, no translated application code, no copied interface
   or assets, no Moonlight protocol stack.
10. **Licensing: `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, source and binaries.** Decided 2026-10-15. Three linked
    pieces are GPL-3.0-or-later: PS5_Vulkan's `app_crt.cpp` and `app_cpp_runtime.cpp` (entry
    point, C++ runtime glue), PS5_PayloadSDK's `libps5platform.a` (heap, thread-stack wraps, libc
    replacements) and the `sce_module/libc.prx` its generator writes. Bring-up builds (WP0–WP5)
    keep them and are GPL-3.0-or-later test builds, never published. WP6 replaces all three with
    our own permissive code, written from the documented facts and not translated from the GPL
    sources. RADV and PyroWave are MIT, Skia BSD, libc++ Apache-2.0 with the LLVM exception;
    `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` is generated by `build.rs` as the webOS client does.

## 1. What is already true (2026-10-15)

Facts the plan stands on, with where each comes from. None is measured by Punktfunk yet.

### 1.1 The console

| Fact | Source | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| The public SDK compiles with `-target x86_64-sie-ps5`, FreeBSD 11.4 headers (`__FreeBSD_version 1104001`), `-femulated-tls -fno-plt -fno-stack-protector`, links `crt1.o`, a thin `libc.a`, and stubs for the console's modules (`libSceVideoOut`, `libSceAudioOut`, `libScePad`, `libSceUserService`, `libSceSystemService`, `libSceSysmodule`, `libSceAgc`, `libSceAgcDriver`, `libSceNet`, `libkernel`). SDK is GPL-3.0; `include/freebsd` is BSD. | `ps5-payload-dev/sdk` `host/bin/prospero-clang`, `libc/Makefile`, `sce_stubs/` | Rust targets a FreeBSD-11 ABI with emulated TLS and PIE. Videodec2 is **not** in the stub set: a hand-written link stub (symbol names only) is how it is linked; no Sony file is needed. |
| The SDK's `getaddrinfo` is a failure stub; sockets are BSD sockets through libkernel; `recvmmsg` exists in the SDK libc. | SDK `libc/netdb.c`, `libc/recvmmsg.c`; ProsperoLight TROUBLESHOOTING | Hostnames do not resolve through `std`. Manual host entry is by address; a resolver over `libSceNet` is optional later. |
| Mesa 26.2.0 with 28 patches is a pacbrew package: RADV with a PS5 winsys on AGC (no DRM), `VK_KHR_display` on VideoOut, zink/EGL on top, `-Dvideo-codecs=` empty, built as `libvulkan.so.1` since the console has no loader. The patches come from `mihawk-99/PS5_Mesa`. | `ps5-payload-dev/pacbrew-repo/mesa/PKGBUILD` and patches 0001–0028 (2026-10-08) | Vulkan is the graphics API. No Vulkan Video. |
| RADV reports Vulkan 1.4 on the console; the pinned 1.4 CTS ran there twice, the second run with 1,569,390 passes and 0 failures. Compute and transfer queue families are served from the graphics ring. Fifteen Vulkan samples hold 119.9 fps at 3840×2160. | `mihawk-99/PS5_Vulkan` README (2026-10-01) | Compute shaders, timeline semaphores, synchronization2 are available. Queue concurrency is not real; the presenter and decoder share one ring. |
| The VideoOut swapchain: one plane, 3840×2160 at 59.94 Hz, 119.88 Hz offered when the title's metadata declares HFR and the display refreshes at it; FIFO is the only present mode; 2–3 images; `B8G8R8A8_UNORM`/`_SRGB`, `SRGB_NONLINEAR` only. A flip thread submits at vblank. The swapchain requires `GetMemoryHostPointerPropertiesEXT`. | Mesa patch 0011 `wsi_common_videoout.c` | 4K120 SDR is the ceiling and the target. HDR needs a WSI change (§9). Host-pointer import works on this driver. |
| On a VRR display a frame presents when ready between 48 and 120 Hz. With the loader's kernel hooks active a system call costs about 20 µs; paused, 0.73 µs. | PS5_Vulkan README, vkQuake measurements | VRR is plausible but unverified for this client. Receive-path syscall cost is a first-week measurement. |
| A title cannot load a repository-built `.so` at run time; the driver is linked into the title. | PS5_Vulkan README | RADV, PyroWave and Skia are static archives in one ELF. |
| Videodec2 decodes H.264 and HEVC (Main, Main10) into GPU-visible memory; a 4K HEVC stream above roughly 80 Mbps at 120 fps exceeds its real-time budget. On 13.60 it fails its first compute query (`811d0111`) once the process has left the title sandbox. | ProsperoLight README, TROUBLESHOOTING, PYROWAVE.md | Decoder initialisation and the whole client stay in the sandbox. 4K120 HEVC is bitrate-capped; PyroWave is the high-bitrate lane. |
| PyroWave runs on RADV on the console in all seven profiles, including HDR10 scanout through a 10-bit BT.2020/PQ VideoOut format; 500–600 Mbps was stable on wired LAN. | ProsperoLight PYROWAVE.md | The GPU and driver carry 4K120 PyroWave. The limit is the network. |
| A title ends through the shell, never by returning from `main` or calling `exit` (the console records that as a crash). AGC is initialised once per process. Four signed-in users give four pads; a pad without a user is invisible. | PS5_VulkanTemplate `ps5/README.md`, ProsperoLight ARCHITECTURE/TROUBLESHOOTING | Lifecycle is a seam with one correct exit. Pad enumeration goes through UserService. |
| Deploy is FTP to `/data/homebrew/<TITLE_ID>/` (port 2121); klog is a TCP stream on port 3232; a scripted test run writes a file into the title folder, the next launch runs it and writes PNGs and a verdict the PC fetches back. | ProsperoLight DEPLOYMENT.md; PS5_VulkanTemplate `tools/run.sh` | The blind-development loop (§5) exists in the ecosystem; this repository adopts its shape. |
| The SDL2 PS5 port (zlib) uses `sceVideoOutOpen/SetBufferAttribute2/RegisterBuffers2/SubmitFlip`, `sceKernelAllocateMainDirectMemory/MapDirectMemory`, `sceAudioOutInit/Open/Output/Close`. | `ps5-payload-dev/SDL` `src/video/ps5`, `src/audio/ps5` | A permissively licensed reference for VideoOut, AudioOut and Pad call shapes. |
| No Rust toolchain or project targets the console. `rustc` has `x86_64-unknown-freebsd` (tier 2, std); the `libc` crate selects a FreeBSD ABI level by `--cfg libc_unstable_freebsd_version="11"`. | rust-lang target list; `libc` 0.2.190 `build.rs` | A custom target JSON derived from the FreeBSD spec, `-Zbuild-std` on a pinned nightly, FreeBSD 11 ABI pinned. §3.1. |

### 1.2 The shared crates (monorepo `0.43.1`, edition 2024, MSRV 1.85)

| Crate | What the PS5 client uses | What has to change upstream |
|---|---|---|
| `pf-console-ui` | `Console::new(ConsoleOptions, ConsoleEntry, &ConsoleHandles)`, `frame(canvas, &Viewport, pad, pad_pref, pads)`, `menu/ok/pointer/key/text`, `take_action() -> OverlayAction`, `ConsoleBus::drain() -> Vec<ConsoleCmd>`, `ConsoleShared`/`LibraryShared` setters, `SnapshotStore`, `Platform`. Fonts are embedded. Screens render to CPU raster in tests (`PF_CONSOLE_DUMP`). | `Platform::Ps5` and its match sites (`rows.rs`, `glyphs.rs`, `ring_editor.rs`, `controls.rs`, `players.rs`); the crate cfg list in `lib.rs` and the Cargo target tables gain the PS5 target; a skia-binaries archive for the target (`git.unom.io/unom/skia-binaries`). |
| `pf-client-core` (`default-features = false`) | `trust::{Settings, KnownHost, KnownHosts, load_or_create_identity, pair_with_host, request_access_to_host, probe_one}`, `presets`, `profiles`, `settings::effective_settings`, `menu_nav::{MenuNav, MenuSample, MenuEvent, PadInfo}`, `console::{OverlayAction, PointerInput}`, `library` types, `shortcuts`, `discovery` (mdns-sd). | `build.rs` `portable` alias and a Cargo target table gain the PS5 target; `discovery`'s OS list too; `shortcuts::Client::Ps5`. Library/art HTTPS fetch is desktop-only upstream; the client keeps its own pinned-TLS fetch as webOS does. |
| `punktfunk-core` (`quic`) | `client::NativeClient::{connect, pair, request_access, probe}`, `next_frame/next_audio/next_rumble/next_hidout/next_hdr_meta/next_host_timing`, `send_input/send_rich_input`, `request_keyframe/request_rfi/report_decode_us`, `reanchor::ReanchorGate`, `hud::Stats`, `phase::{CadenceClock, PanelGrid, pace_slot}`, caps bits (`CODEC_PYROWAVE 0x08`, `VIDEO_CAP_*`), `audio::JitterPolicy`. Media reads run on a native thread through `quinn_udp::UdpSocketState`. | Nothing by design; `cfg(unix)` covers the target. The transport's socket options on libkernel are a WP0 probe. |
| `pf-client-video` (`default-features = false, features = ["pyrowave"]`) | `video_vk::{VulkanDecodeDevice, QueueLock}`, `video_pyrowave::PyroWaveDecoder` → `PyroWavePlanarFrame` (three plane views on the presenter's device), `video_color::ColorDesc`, `video_csc_spv` (committed SPIR-V), `DecodedFrame/DecodedImage`. | Cargo target tables (today `linux | windows | android`) and `pyrowave-sys`'s bindgen gate gain the PS5 target. |
| `pyrowave-sys` | Vendored PyroWave + Granite via cmake; C API 0.6.0; device requirements: Vulkan ≥ 1.3, `shaderInt16`, `storageBuffer8BitAccess`, `timelineSemaphore`, `subgroupSizeControl`, `computeFullSubgroups`, `synchronization2`, subgroup `VOTE|BALLOT|ARITHMETIC|SHUFFLE|SHUFFLE_RELATIVE|BASIC`; `shaderFloat16` optional. | cmake toolchain file for the PS5 compiler; the gate. |
| `clients/android/native/src/pyro/{device,present}.rs` | The reference for a Vulkan presenter without SDL: own `ash` instance and device, exported as `VulkanDecodeDevice`, three planes sampled by the shared CSC on its own swapchain. `crates/client/pf-console-ui/src/skia_overlay.rs` is the reference for a Skia `DirectContext` over `ash` handles. | Read, not linked. |
| `clients/probe` | `--trajectory` drives `NativeClient` headlessly; `main.rs` is the wire-level teaching copy. | The headless console probe in WP0 is modelled on `trajectory.rs`. |

All three monorepo dependencies are pinned to one git **rev**, never a tag — the webOS lesson:
a tag and a rev build two copies and the types do not unify.

### 1.3 What the webOS client gives this one

Lifted as they are, renamed where `Tv` says `Ps5`: the `core::media` traits (`VideoSink`,
`AudioSink`, `AudioPlane`, `MediaClock`, `VideoSinkCaps`), `session/{stage,timeline,pump,audio,
stats,probe,pad_audio}` with their `FakeSink` tests (freeze-until-reanchor, one PTS mapping per
picture, frames counted only on `Presented`), `services/{atomic,store,paths,join,budget,art,
library,status,pinned_tls,discovery,wol}`, `logger/{sink,ring,level}` (file + TCP telemetry +
on-screen ring), the `console/model.rs` service loop over `ConsoleCmd`, `runtime`'s
`UiOutcome`/`StreamOutcome` alternation, `build.rs`'s notices generator, the go-task + Docker
shape, and the CI that lints with `-D warnings` on the cross target because a host `cargo check`
proves nothing about gated code.

Not lifted: anything under `platform/webos`, the NDL sink, the pointer UI (`app/` — the console
is pad-only), SDL2, the glibc shim, `luna`/`ls2`.

Fixed rather than copied: the webOS `session ↔ platform` edge runs both ways in practice
(`session::pipeline::load_player` names the NDL constructors; `platform::audio` reaches into
`session::audio`). Here the backend choice is injected by the binary and the platform crate does
not depend on the application crate at all (§2).

## 2. Architecture

```text
  pf-ps5 (bin)            the title: SDK entry glue, wires ps5 adapters into the app, never returns
      │
  pf-ps5-app              portable, no unsafe: core (domain, seams, fakes), session (on
      │                   punktfunk-core), ui (Console hosting), services (store, discovery,
      │                   library, art), runtime (menu ⇄ stream), logger
      ├── pf-console-ui · pf-client-core · punktfunk-core
      │
  pf-ps5-vk               portable, unsafe with proofs: the Vulkan device wrapper and QueueLock,
      │                   the presenter (two lanes → one CSC → swapchain), pacing, the Skia
      │                   DirectContext, the PyroWave lane, frame read-back
      ├── ash · skia-safe · pf-client-video
      │
  pf-ps5-platform         the console: device on RADV + VK_KHR_display, AudioOut sink,
      │                   Pad/UserService, Videodec2 lane, /download0 storage, lifecycle, klog
      └── pf-ps5-sys      hand-written FFI: VideoOut types, AudioOut, Pad, UserService,
                          SystemService, Sysmodule, Videodec2, direct memory, klog; layout tests

  pf-ps5-host             the developer box: device via the loader, offscreen/windowed surface,
                          WAV or null audio, scripted pads, a temp dir, process exit
```

Dependency direction, enforced by Cargo: `pf-ps5-sys` ← `pf-ps5-platform` ← `pf-ps5` →
`pf-ps5-app` → `pf-ps5-vk`, and `pf-ps5-host` → `pf-ps5-app`. The application crate defines the
seams and knows no platform; both platform crates depend on the application crate's seam module
only (a `pf-ps5-app::platform` module, or a small `pf-ps5-seams` crate if the app crate grows a
dependency a platform crate must not inherit) and on `pf-ps5-vk` for the device type they hand
back. `pf-ps5-platform` and `pf-ps5-sys` are `cfg(target_vendor = "sie")`; `pf-ps5-host` is
`cfg(not(target_vendor = "sie"))`. The binary picks one. Tests run the app against `fake`
implementations on every CI runner and against `host` on a runner with a GPU or lavapipe.

### 2.1 Threads

| Thread | Owns | Never |
|---|---|---|
| main | the Vulkan device, swapchain, Skia context, `Console`, overlays, present | blocks on the network or a decoder |
| pump | `NativeClient::next_frame`, loss accounting, `ReanchorGate`, decode submit (`VideoStage`) | touches the swapchain |
| audio | `next_audio` → Opus decode → `JitterPolicy` ring → AudioOut grains (256 frames) | allocates per grain |
| input | Pad sampling at 250 Hz, `MenuNav`, `InputEvent` send, feedback (rumble, triggers, lightbar) | draws |
| service | `ConsoleCmd` handling: discovery, pairing, library and art fetch, probes, log upload | holds a GPU resource |
| client | `punktfunk-core`'s own tokio runtime and media reader | — |

The pump hands the presenter a decoded image plus a timeline value; the presenter picks the frame
due at the next vblank with `punktfunk_core::phase` (`CadenceClock` on the VideoOut vblank
period, `pace_slot`) and the webOS `Pacing` map. No frame queue is unbounded; the PyroWave lane
keeps two frames and decodes the newest, the Videodec2 lane keeps the decoder's own pool.

### 2.2 The seams (traits in `pf-ps5-app::platform`)

```rust
pub trait Gpu {                       // one per process
    fn device(&self) -> &VulkanDevice;            // ash handles + the QueueLock pf-client-video shares
    fn acquire(&mut self) -> Result<Frame>;       // swapchain image + the vblank the present targets
    fn present(&mut self, frame: Frame) -> Result<()>;
    fn refresh(&self) -> Refresh;                 // 59.94 / 119.88 Hz, measured from vblanks
    fn read_back(&mut self, into: &mut [u8]) -> Result<Extent>;   // test runs only
}
pub trait AudioOut: Send + Sync {
    fn open(&mut self, channels: u8, rate: u32) -> Result<AudioPort>;
    fn write(&self, port: &AudioPort, pcm: &[i16]) -> Result<()>;  // blocks one grain
    fn depth_ms(&self, port: &AudioPort) -> Option<i64>;
}
pub trait Pads: Send {
    fn poll(&mut self, out: &mut Vec<PadSample>);  // all signed-in users, 250 Hz
    fn feedback(&mut self, pad: PadId, out: &HidOutput);
    fn identity(&self, pad: PadId) -> PadIdentity;  // DualSense / DualSense Edge / other
}
pub trait HardwareDecoder: Send {     // the Videodec2 lane; PyroWave is pf-client-video
    fn open(&mut self, codec: Codec, w: u32, h: u32, ten_bit: bool) -> Result<()>;
    fn decode(&mut self, au: &[u8], pts_ns: u64) -> Result<Option<HwFrame>>;  // HwFrame: VkImage + wait
    fn release(&mut self, frame: HwFrame);
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<()>;
}
pub trait Storage { fn data_dir(&self) -> &Path; fn write_atomic(&self, path, bytes) -> Result<()>; }
pub trait Lifecycle { fn hide_splash(&self); fn exit(&self) -> !; fn poll_events(&mut self) -> Vec<SystemEvent>; }
pub trait LogSink: Write + Send {}    // klog, file in data_dir, optional TCP telemetry
```

Signatures are indicative; the contract tests in `pf-ps5-app/tests/seams/` are the spec. Each
trait has a `fake` in `pf-ps5-app` used by those tests and by the app's own unit tests, so the
session, the store and the console service are fully tested without a GPU or a console.

## 3. The three hard problems

### 3.1 Rust on `x86_64-sie-ps5`

A custom target JSON, committed as `targets/x86_64-sie-ps5.json`, derived from
`rustc --print target-spec-json --target x86_64-unknown-freebsd`:

| Key | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `llvm-target` | `x86_64-sie-ps5` | LLVM knows the PS5 as a platform; the SDK compiles everything else with this triple. Fallback if codegen differs in a way that matters: `x86_64-unknown-freebsd` with the SDK's clang as the linker. |
| `os` / `vendor` / `env` | `freebsd` / `sie` / `""` | `std`'s FreeBSD port is the one that matches the kernel and libc ABI; `target_vendor = "sie"` is the gate word in shared crates: `cfg(all(target_os = "freebsd", target_vendor = "sie"))`. |
| `has-thread-local` | `false` | The SDK compiles with `-femulated-tls`; `std` then keys thread locals through `pthread_key`. |
| `linker` / `linker-flavor` | `prospero-clang` / `gnu-lld-cc` | The SDK's wrapper adds the sysroot, `crt1.o`, `-lc -lSceLibcInternal -lSceNet -lkernel_web`. |
| `position-independent-executables` | `true` | The SDK builds position-independent ELFs. |
| `panic-strategy` | `abort` | No unwinding across the C boundaries; a panic writes the log and aborts (§5.4). |
| `cpu` | `znver2` | The console's CPU; Mesa's PS5 patches already assume AVX2 (patch 0027). |

Build: `cargo +<pinned nightly> build -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target targets/x86_64-sie-ps5.json`
with `RUSTFLAGS='--cfg libc_unstable_freebsd_version="11" --cfg getrandom_backend="custom"'`.
The `getrandom` custom backend wraps `arc4random_buf` from the SDK libc (the kernel has no
`getrandom(2)`); it is implemented in `pf-ps5-sys`, as the webOS client sets `linux_raw`.

Known gaps between `std`'s FreeBSD port and the console, each a WP0 probe with a shim in
`pf-ps5-sys` if it fails: `__error`, `_umtx_op` (mutex and condvar), `kqueue`/`kevent` (mio under
tokio and mdns-sd), `sysctl` (`available_parallelism`), `elf_aux_info`, `getrandom`, `dl_iterate_phdr`
(backtraces; RADV's patch 0021 says the console lacks it), `pthread_getthreadid_np`,
`clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`. The SDK's `libc/` directory lists what Sony's libc lacks and
the SDK supplies — the first place to look when a symbol is missing.

The dependency chain that must compile and run: `libc`, `socket2`, `mio`, `tokio`, `quinn`,
`quinn-udp`, `rustls` with **aws-lc-rs** (the workspace pins it; `ring` is not in core's graph),
`rcgen`, `mdns-sd`, `if-addrs`, `opus` (libopus via cmake or the pacbrew package), `ureq` with
`rustls-no-provider`, `image` (PNG/JPEG only), `serde_json`, `skia-safe`, `ash`, `pyrowave-sys`.
`aws-lc-sys` is the one with a cmake and assembler build; FreeBSD x86_64 is a supported aws-lc
platform, so the risk is the toolchain file, not the code. If it does not build in the first
week, the fallback is a `ring` provider, which needs the maintainer's yes in the monorepo.

### 3.2 Vulkan from Rust, statically

`ash` with the `linked`-style entry: RADV is a static archive, `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` is a
link-time symbol, `ash::Entry::from_static_fn` wraps it. The archive is built from the pacbrew
Mesa package's exact source and patches with `-Ddefault_library=static`, pinned by the patch set's
sha1 (the PKGBUILD computes a `radv-build-id` the same way; without it RADV finds no shader cache
and silently has no device). Meson's cross file comes from the SDK (`prospero.ini`). Device
bring-up mirrors `clients/android/native/src/pyro/device.rs`: `VK_KHR_surface` + `VK_KHR_display`
on the instance, `VK_KHR_swapchain` + `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` on the device, the exact
feature list PyroWave reconstructs from `VulkanDecodeDevice` (§1.2), one graphics queue behind
`QueueLock`.

Skia: `skia-safe` with `vulkan,textlayout`, built once from source by skia-bindings with the SDK
compilers (`FORCE_SKIA_BUILD=1`, GN `target_os="linux"` with `cc`/`cxx`/`ar` overridden,
`skia_use_fontconfig=false`, bundled FreeType, no X11, no system freetype), published as the
archive the Cargo build downloads — the webOS armv7 recipe. The console draws with Skia's Vulkan
backend on the shared device, `DirectContext` over `ash` handles as `skia_overlay.rs` does, into
an offscreen RGBA slot composited by the presenter. Fallback for bring-up and for a backend
defect: CPU raster into a staging buffer uploaded each frame; the kit already renders that way in
its tests.

Shader cache: RADV's on-disk cache (`MESA_DISK_CACHE_DATABASE`) under `/download0`, keyed by the
pinned Mesa revision; the release ships a warmed cache so the first launch compiles nothing.
Measured by PS5_Vulkan: 3.77 s to first present from an empty cache versus 2.44 s warm.

### 3.3 Decoded frames into Vulkan without a CPU copy

PyroWave is solved by construction: it decodes on the shared device into `PyroWavePlanarFrame`
and the presenter samples the planes. Videodec2 is the open question, in three measured steps:

1. The decoder's output buffers are allocated by the client in direct memory
   (`sceKernelAllocateMainDirectMemory` + `sceKernelMapDirectMemory`) with the alignment the
   decoder asks for; the same mapping is imported as `VkDeviceMemory` through
   `VK_EXT_external_memory_host` and bound to a `VkImage` (NV12 as two R8/R8G8 planes, P010 as
   R16/R16G16). The presenter's CSC shader samples it. Zero copies.
2. If the decoder's stride or tiling does not match what RADV accepts for a linear image: one GPU
   copy from an imported buffer into a device-local image. One copy, GPU-side.
3. If host-pointer import fails for decoder memory: a staging upload per frame. 3840×2160 NV12 is
   12.4 MiB; at 120 fps that is 1.5 GB/s over the CPU — recorded as a number, not promised away.

Each frame carries the decoder's completion signal; the presenter waits on it before sampling and
hands the buffer back only after both the decoder and the last present that used it are done
(`HwFrame::release`). The lane produces `DecodedImage`-shaped frames so the presenter does not
know which lane fed it.

## 4. Work packages and exit criteria

Each package names what the tester does and what is proven without the console. "Bundle" means a
test-run bundle (§5.2). A package is done when its exit line is true on the console and in CI.

### WP0 — Toolchain and runtime (the two-week investigation)

Build: the target JSON, the pinned nightly and SDK revision, `scripts/toolchain.sh` installing
both into a Docker image, the cmake/meson cross files, a `task build-probe`. The `pf-ps5-probe`
binary runs numbered checks and prints one `probe NN ok|fail <detail>` line per check to klog and
to its log file: allocation, threads, thread-locals, mutex/condvar under contention, monotonic and
wall clocks, `available_parallelism`, files in `/download0` (create, rename, fsync, reopen after
relaunch), `arc4random`, UDP send/recv with `quinn_udp::UdpSocketState::new` and every socket
option `punktfunk-core` sets, TCP connect, TLS handshake with rustls/aws-lc-rs against the host's
management port, mDNS browse, `recvmmsg` batch size and the per-datagram cost at 10k datagrams/s,
a tokio runtime with two workers, a `std::process::abort` after writing the log. Then the headless
client: `NativeClient::pair`, `NativeClient::connect` at 1080p60, 600 frames received, input
sent, identity saved and reused on relaunch — `clients/probe/src/trajectory.rs` as the model.

Both launch forms are tested: the ELF on port 9021 and the probe installed as a title.

Tester: deploys the probe once as a payload and once as a title, launches each, closes it, runs
`task fetch-bundle`. Records model, firmware, loader and its hooks setting, display and its modes,
network link, in the first bundle's `environment.json` (a form in the probe's launch screen).

Without the console: the probe runs on `host` in CI; the target compiles in CI with `-D warnings`;
the ABI layout tests in `pf-ps5-sys` pin every struct the client passes to the console against the
sizes read from the SDK's FreeBSD headers.

**Exit:** every probe line `ok` in both forms on 13.60; the headless client pairs, reconnects with
its saved identity, receives frames, sends input; the dependency patch inventory is written down
(crate, version, patch or shim, upstreamable or not). If `std`'s port needs more than shims — a
fork of `std` — the scope is reassessed before WP1.

### WP1 — Vulkan on the console from Rust

RADV linked statically; instance, device, `VK_KHR_display` surface, three-image FIFO swapchain;
a clear and a textured quad; the PyroWave feature probe (`pf-presenter`'s list) printed as one
line; present pacing with the measured vblank period; `param.json` declaring HFR; a read-back of
the last frame to `verdict/frame.png`. PyroWave decoder created and fed one shipped sample frame.

Tester: launch, 30 s, close, fetch.

Without the console: the same program on `host` renders the same frame; `scripts/compare.py`
accepts a mean difference under 4.5/255 at 480×270 (the PS5_VulkanTemplate tolerance).

**Exit:** 3,000 frames at 119.88 Hz with zero missed vblanks in the bundle's pacing record; the
feature line matches what PyroWave requires; the console frame matches the host frame; the
PyroWave sample decodes and its three planes match the host's decode.

### WP2 — The shared console on the console

Skia for the target (§3.2); `Console` on the Skia Vulkan backend; `scePad` → `MenuSample` →
`MenuNav`; `SnapshotStore` over `/download0` with the webOS `StateWriter`; the service loop over
`ConsoleCmd`: discovery, `Pair`, `RequestAccess`, `FetchLibrary` + `push_art` through a pinned-TLS
client, `Probe`, `SaveHost/UpdateHost/ForgetHost`, `SendLogs`, `LoadLicenses`; `Platform::Ps5`
rows. The About screen shows the build id, the Mesa pin and the notices.

Tester: add host by address → request access → approve on the PC → library with covers → open
Settings → close. A second launch shows the host still paired.

Without the console: `PF_CONSOLE_DUMP` on the desktop and the `host` platform render the same
screens; the shared parity vectors (`clients/shared/console-vectors.json`) run in the app's tests;
the store round-trips the shared `settings.json` document whole (unmapped fields untouched).

**Exit:** console screens on the PS5 match the desktop dump within tolerance; add → pair → browse
by pad; pairing survives relaunch; no PS5-only settings key outside `extra` under `ps5.`.

### WP3 — The video plane

Both lanes behind the presenter: `pf-client-video`'s PyroWave decoder on the shared device, and
the Videodec2 lane (§3.3) for H.264 and HEVC at 8 and 10 bit; the planar CSC SPIR-V; pacing on
the vblank clock; `ReanchorGate` and the webOS `VideoStage` (hold on loss, resume on anchor, one
PTS map per picture); `hud::Stats` with decode and present stamps; the stats overlay.

Tester: three scripted sessions against their host — 4K60 HEVC, 4K120 HEVC at 60 Mbps, 4K120
PyroWave at 400 Mbps — 60 s each, then fetch.

Without the console: the lanes run on `host` from recorded elementary streams (the probe's
`--out` files from a real host) with the presenter writing frames; the `VideoStage` tests; the
decoder plan tests (dimensions, stride, pool size, release order) are device-free as in
`pf-vkdecode`.

**Exit:** all three sessions play with p95 decode-to-present under one frame interval and no
growing queue; the Videodec2 import step actually taken (1, 2 or 3 of §3.3) is recorded with its
per-frame cost; a 4K HEVC stream above the decoder's budget degrades to a reported hold, not a
crash.

### WP4 — The first playable client

Session pump, audio (AudioOut, `JitterPolicy`, stereo), one DualSense with rumble and adaptive
triggers through `scePad`, the disconnect chord and hold-to-exit, connect/reconnect with the
shared messages, `SessionPhase` into the console, system events (home button, controller loss →
release held inputs; suspend → end the session cleanly), the one correct exit.

Tester: add host → pair → browse → launch a game → play ten minutes → return to the library →
launch the desktop → disconnect → quit → relaunch, still paired. Report input feel in one sentence
and anything that stuck.

Without the console: the runtime loop runs end-to-end on `host` against the containerised host
from the webOS `docker:deploy` recipe (synthetic source, software encoder), including reconnects.

**Exit:** the whole path works with the pad alone; restart preserves pairing; held inputs are
released on every exit path; no new player-facing setting.

### WP5 — Reliability and latency

Soaks and faults: two hours at 4K120 PyroWave and two at 4K60 HEVC without a crash, memory
growth, queue growth or audio drift; 30 launch/stop/relaunch cycles; host restart, cable pull, pad
off and on, wrong fingerprint, corrupted `settings.json`, interrupted save. Percentiles for
receive→decode and decode→present, queue depth, misses, underruns, in the bundle.

Tester: the soak is a scripted run they start and leave; the fault list is a numbered checklist
with one line to write per item. The camera test: a phone at 240 fps on the pad's light bar (set
by the client on a button press) and the TV; the developer counts frames from the clip.

**Exit:** both soaks clean; every fault returns to an actionable screen with no stuck input; p95
client processing within two 120 Hz frames on the wired baseline; the camera number recorded
beside the same host and display measured with another Punktfunk client where the tester has one.

### WP6 — Package and release

First, the three GPL pieces of D10 go, each in its own change behind the probe and WP1's bundle:
a Rust entry point with the init arrays; our own platform layer (heap on MIT dlmalloc, stack wraps,
the libc replacements RADV and std call); our own `libc.prx` generator. **Exit for this step:**
`nm` of the linked title and the `link-title.sh` inputs name no GPL object, and the WP4 soak
passes on the replacements.

`task package` → `dist/<TITLE_ID>/` and a zip; checksums; `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`; the pins
file (SDK, Mesa patch set, Skia, PyroWave, monorepo rev, nightly); install, update with pairing
kept, and rollback procedures tested by the tester; GitHub Releases from CI on a tag; the
monorepo's install page gains the PS5 entry (with the maintainer's yes). Then §9, one capability at
a time.

## 5. Developing without the console

The tester's time is the scarce resource. Everything below exists to spend it on what only the
console can answer.

### 5.1 The platform matrix

| | `ps5` | `host` | `fake` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Builds | Docker, the pinned image | native, any box | native |
| Runs | the console | a dev box or a GPU/lavapipe CI runner | every CI runner |
| Proves | the console | the app against a real Vulkan device and real sockets | contracts, state machines, stores |
| Pixels | read-back PNG in the bundle | PNG from the same code path | none |

A change to `pf-ps5-app` is tested on `fake` and `host` before it is built for `ps5`. A change to
`pf-ps5-platform` or `pf-ps5-sys` ships with the probe check or bundle field that will show it
working, written before the console sees it.

### 5.2 Test runs and bundles

`task deploy` uploads what changed over FTP (temporary name, rename on completion, `param.json`
last). `task test-run <scenario>` writes `test-run.json` into the title folder; the next launch
reads and deletes it, runs the scenario on its own (connect to the named host with the saved
pairing, play N seconds, exit), and writes `/download0/verdict/<time>/`: `log.txt`, the klog
excerpt if a klog capture was running, `frame-*.png`, `perf.json` (percentiles, counters,
pacing trace), `environment.json`. `task fetch-bundle` pulls the folder over FTP. The developer
reads bundles; the tester runs tasks. `docs/tester.md` is the tester's whole manual: install
the task runner, set `PS5_HOST`, run the three tasks, what "closed" means (fully, including the
crash dialog), and where to paste the one-line result.

### 5.3 Logging

The webOS logger: `tracing` through a non-blocking writer into `/download0/logs/` rotated per
launch under the host's 1 MiB bundle limit, an optional TCP sink named at launch (`-p telemetry=
IP:PORT`, the tester runs `nc -lk`), a 32-line ring for the on-screen log overlay, one live level.
Operator-register lines; the first line is the build id and the pins. `SendLogs` uploads the file
to the host as every client does, so the tester can hand over logs through their own host console.

### 5.4 Crashes

`panic = "abort"`. The panic hook writes the message and the frame-pointer stack (built with
`force-frame-pointers=yes`) to the log before aborting; a `SIGSEGV`/`SIGBUS` handler does the
same with the faulting address. Every CI build keeps its unstripped ELF as an artifact and
`scripts/symbolize.py <log> <elf>` names the frames. A crash without a bundle is a bug in the
tooling first.

### 5.5 Rules

- Every claim about the hardware in `docs/NOTES.md` cites a bundle id. "Should work" is not a
  claim.
- A console run tests at most one unknown. Two unknowns in one run cost two runs anyway.
- The build id is on screen (About) and in the first log line. A report without it is re-run.
- Nothing is asked of the tester that CI or `host` could have answered.
- The probe gains a check for every platform assumption the app code makes. The app does not
  carry a workaround whose cause the probe has not isolated.

## 6. Repository layout

```text
client-ps5/
  Cargo.toml               workspace; one monorepo rev for all three shared crates

```

Conventions: `pf-ps5-sys` is the only crate with `extern "C"`; `pf-ps5-vk` is the only other
crate that allows `unsafe`, and every block has a `// SAFETY:` proof; the rest is
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; clippy pedantic set from the webOS
manifest, `-D warnings` on the cross target in CI; writing rules from the monorepo's
`docs/writing.md` (commits, comments, two error registers); `AGENTS.md` at the root with the
layering, the commands and the invariants, kept to one screen.

## 7. Upstream changes (monorepo), each its own PR

1. `pf-console-ui`: `Platform::Ps5`; the match sites; the `lib.rs` cfg list and the Cargo tables
   gain `all(target_os = "freebsd", target_vendor = "sie")`; `shortcuts::Client::Ps5` in
   `pf-client-core`.
2. `pf-client-core`: `build.rs` `portable` alias and a Cargo target table; `discovery`'s OS list.
3. `pf-client-video` and `pyrowave-sys`: Cargo tables and the bindgen gate; a cmake toolchain
   hook (`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` already honoured by cmake-rs).
4. `skia-binaries`: the PS5 archive, with the build recipe beside the sha256 table.
5. Docs: the install page entry and the support matrix row, at WP6.
6. Only if WP0 forces it: a `ring` provider feature for the client side of `punktfunk-core`.

Nothing on the wire, nothing in the settings catalog.

## 8. Risks

| # | Risk | Trigger | Fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | `std`'s FreeBSD port needs symbols the console lacks | WP0 probe lines | Shims in `pf-ps5-sys` over libkernel, the SDK's `libc/` pattern. More than shims → reassess before WP1. |
| R2 | `aws-lc-sys` does not cross-build | WP0, first week | A `ring` provider for the client side of `punktfunk-core` (upstream yes needed). |
| R3 | Static RADV in a Rust ELF: symbol clashes (Mesa's c11 threads, libc++), link time, size | WP1 | Patch 0022 already renames Mesa's threads; `--gc-sections` + LTO; a 40 MiB title is acceptable. |
| R4 | Skia will not build for the target | WP2 | GN as `linux` with overridden compilers is the plan; if GN refuses, patch skia-bindings' build support for the triple; the UI path itself has no alternative and this risk is first in WP2. |
| R5 | Videodec2's ABI is community-reconstructed; the 13.60 sandbox trap; stride/tiling of its output | WP3 | PyroWave-only first release; HEVC lands when the lane passes. |
| R6 | 119.88 Hz needs the display and the metadata; VRR unverified; HDR absent from the WSI | WP1, §9 | Ship 4K60 if 120 is refused; VRR and HDR stay unadvertised until a bundle shows them. |
| R7 | Receive-path syscall cost with the loader's hooks (~20 µs each) at 13k datagrams/s | WP0 measurement | `recvmmsg` batching (already in `quinn_udp` where the libc has it), larger `SO_RCVBUF`, pump thread priority; document the loader setting the tester can change. |
| R8 | One tester; days of turnaround | always | §5. |
| R9 | The `libc.prx` layout the loader accepts is documented only beside GPL code | WP6 | Rebuild it from the probe's observations of a working title; keep the GPL generator for test builds until a replacement boots. |
| R10 | Memory: swapchain 3 × 32 MiB, decoder pool, PyroWave buffers, Skia cache, QUIC buffers | WP3 soak | Budgets in `perf.json`; `gpu_cache_bytes` down to the kit's 96 MiB floor. |
| R11 | The pacbrew Mesa package warns that its patches were machine-generated and unreviewed | ongoing | Pin by patch-set hash; the CTS result is the evidence; re-run WP1's bundle on every bump. |

## 9. After the baseline

In order, each gated by a bundle: HDR10 (a WSI patch for a 10-bit BT.2020/PQ surface format plus
VideoOut HDR metadata; ProsperoLight shows the path exists), 5.1 and 7.1 through the eight-channel
AudioOut port, two to four pads (one per signed-in user), DualSense haptics and speaker over the
pad-audio plane, keyboard and mouse (`libSceKeyboard`, `libSceMouse`), VRR verification on a
display that reports it, a `libSceNet` resolver for hostnames, the console's touchpad and motion
as `RichInput`. AV1 is not planned: the console has no decoder for it and the GPU driver has no
Vulkan Video.

## 10. Sequence and timebox

WP0 → WP1 → WP2 ∥ WP3 → WP4 → WP5 → WP6. WP2 and WP3 proceed in parallel once WP1's device is
up. The first two weeks are WP0 and WP1 as an investigation: their output is a feasibility report
— the probe bundle, the Vulkan frame, the PyroWave feature line, the dependency patch inventory —
and an estimate for the rest from measured blockers rather than from this plan. The timebox bounds
the investigation, not the port.

## 11. Open before WP0 starts

- **Tester's setup** (into the first `environment.json`): model, firmware, loader and whether
  its kernel hooks can be paused, display and its 4K120/VRR/HDR support, wired or wireless, FTP
  and klog services available.
- **Title ID**: a `PPSA99xxx` value not used by another homebrew title.
- **Maintainer's yes**: §7 items 1–4, and the `ring` fallback should R2 fire.
- **Where this document lives**: here, beside the code it plans, with a one-line pointer from the
  planning repository's index.
