# Testing punktfunk on a PS5

This page takes you from a fresh clone to the logs the developer needs. You run a few tasks on
your computer; the developer reads what they bring back. Nothing has run on a console yet, so
expect failures: a failure with its log is a good result.

## What you need

- **The console:** a PS5 that runs homebrew (13.42 is proven; 13.60 is what the sources
  describe), with an FTP server on port 2121
  and a title loader that launches folders in `/data/homebrew`. A klog server on port 3232 is
  optional and helps with crashes.
- **A computer** on the same network with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
  [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) and this repository. The live log and `task klog`
  need `nc`, which macOS and Linux have.
- **A punktfunk host** on the same network ([install it](https://docs.punktfunk.unom.io/docs/install))
  and its IP address. Use a cable for the console and the host in the stream rounds.
- **The build:** `title.zip` from the developer. It holds both titles: **punktfunk** (PPSA99724)
  and **punktfunk probe** (PPSA99725).

## Set up once

1. Clone this repository and open a terminal in it.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `PS5_HOST` to the console's IP address. Leave the title
   ids as they are.
3. Unpack the build. Do this again with every new build:

   ```sh
   task unpack -- ~/Downloads/title.zip
   ```

> **Close a title before you deploy it.** Closed means gone from the home screen, including any
> crash dialog: close the dialog first. A deploy under a running title leaves it half-replaced.

## Round 1: the probe

The probe checks what the client needs from the console, one line per check, then closes
itself. It runs twice: the second launch checks that its files and its pairing survived.

1. Upload it. A new title takes up to 45 seconds to appear on the home screen.

   ```sh
   task probe-deploy
   ```

2. In the host's web console, open **Devices**, click **Pair a device** and **Show PIN**. The PIN
   lasts two minutes.
3. Name the host and the PIN:

   ```sh
   task probe-host -- 192.168.1.20 1234
   ```

4. Launch **punktfunk probe** from the home screen and leave it alone until it closes.
5. Fetch its log. It prints one line: `ok: …`, `FAILED (…): …` or `STOPPED in …`.

   ```sh
   task probe-fetch
   ```

6. Launch **punktfunk probe** again, wait until it closes, and run `task probe-fetch` again.

Send both printed lines and the files in `bundles/PPSA99725/`. With this first report, also
tell the developer your console model, firmware, title loader and its version, the display and
its highest refresh rate, and whether the console is on a cable or Wi-Fi.

## Round 2: the menu

1. Upload the client and queue the menu scenario:

   ```sh
   task deploy
   task test-run -- menu
   ```

2. Launch **punktfunk** and leave the controller alone. It draws its menu, saves pictures of it
   and closes itself.
3. Fetch the result. Send the line it prints and the folder it names.

   ```sh
   task fetch-bundle
   ```

## Round 3: pair and stream

1. Launch **punktfunk**. If your host is not listed, choose **Add host** and enter its IP
   address. Host names don't work on the console.
2. Pick the host and pair it. Either choose **Request access — approve on the host** and click
   **Approve** under **Devices** in the host's web console, or type a PIN from **Pair a device**
   into **PIN** and choose **Pair**. The [pairing guide](https://docs.punktfunk.unom.io/docs/pairing)
   shows the host's side.
3. Go back to the home screen and choose **Quit**. The hint bar names the button.
4. Queue a stream to your host for 60 seconds, launch **punktfunk** and leave the controller
   alone until it closes:

   ```sh
   task test-run -- stream 192.168.1.20 60
   ```

5. Run `task fetch-bundle` and send the line and the folder.

## Playing

After a stream round passes, play as you would on any client.

| Press | To |
| --- | --- |
| Hold the touchpad click, press Cross | Open the quick menu in a stream |
| Hold L1 + R1 + Options + touchpad click for one second | End the stream |

The Create and PS buttons belong to the console and never reach the game.

When something goes wrong, note the time and what you did. A live log tells the developer the
rest. Before launching, start a listener on your computer, then deploy with your computer's IP
address:

```sh
nc -lk 9999 | tee live.log
TELEMETRY=192.168.1.10:9999 task deploy
```

Send `live.log`. A plain `task deploy` turns the live log off again.

## Troubleshooting

### `Couldn't reach the console at …`

The console's FTP server is not running, or `PS5_HOST` is wrong. Start the FTP server and check
the address in `.env`.

### The title does not appear on the home screen

A new title takes up to 45 seconds. If it is still missing, start your title loader and wait
again.

### `No bundle on the console yet` or `No probe.log on the console yet`

The title did not finish its run. Queue the run again, launch, and wait for the title to close by
itself. If it crashes, run `task klog > klog.txt` in a second terminal before the next launch and
send `klog.txt`.

### `STOPPED in check …`

The probe ended inside that check, usually by crashing. Close the crash dialog, then send the log
with a `task klog` capture of the same launch.

### The PIN is refused

It lasts two minutes. Show a new one, run `task probe-host` again with it, then launch.
